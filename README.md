This repository contains the code and analysis of the projects done in the data science job simulation by Forage on British Airways. It contains two notebooks, the first one has the task of web scrapping and review analysis and the second notebook contains building machine learning model for analysis on tbookings.
Task 1- To import reviews from a airlines review website and do analysis on it. I did sentiment analysis and the findings are in the notebook attatched.
Task2- To build machine learning model which can find the features important in bookings. I made random forest classifier and found the important features.
