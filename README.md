In this project, I developed a custom predictive model in Python to analyze the key factors influencing consumer buying behavior. The project involved the following steps:

Data Collection and Cleaning:
Gathered and cleaned raw datasets using pandas and numpy, addressing missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using matplotlib and seaborn to uncover trends, correlations, and data distributions.

Feature Engineering:
Created new features from the data, such as customer segmentation, product interaction metrics, and purchasing patterns, to capture relevant insights.
Applied techniques like one-hot encoding, normalization, and log transformations to improve data quality.

Custom Model Implementation:
Built a predictive model from scratch using Python, incorporating statistical methods and decision rules to predict consumer buying behavior.
Carefully selected input variables to model key aspects of buying decisions, avoiding external machine learning libraries.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluated model performance with custom metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices, visualizing results for interpretability.
Manually fine-tuned parameters and features through trial-and-error to optimize predictive power.

Feature Importance Analysis:
Generated a feature importance report based on the model's final structure, ranking the most influential factors affecting buying behavior.
The report provided a clear view of which customer attributes (e.g., purchase frequency, product category, customer demographics) played the largest role in the predictions.

Insights and Reporting:
Delivered key insights on the drivers of consumer purchases, with implications for targeted marketing and customer engagement strategies.
Presented findings with visualizations and clear summaries to highlight the top factors contributing to consumer decisions.
